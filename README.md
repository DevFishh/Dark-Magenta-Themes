# Dark Magenta Themes 
Source for my Dark Magenta themes, which I have coded for various websites and applications

## How To Install (BetterDiscord Theme)
1. Go to https://github.com/DevFishh/Dark-Magenta-Themes/releases/tag/BetterDiscord
2. Find "BetterDiscord v2.0" (this is latest version and should be the only version there)
3. Under "Assets" click "DarkMagenta.theme.css" This should start the download process. 
4. After you download the file, move it into the BetterDiscord Themes folder.
5. Enjoy! As long as you have the latest file version, theme updates should be automatic. 

## How To Install (Other Themes)
Each .css file has an info section at the beginning of the file.

"EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS" shows what software you need to execute the code.

If those requirements are met, all you need to do is copy the text after "EXECUTION STRING" and paste it into whatever software is required to inject the code.

Make sure you paste it BEFORE any other lines of code BUT AFTER any @charset declarations (such as @name , @version , @author , etc) or it will not work
