# Dark Magenta Themes 
Source for my Dark Magenta themes, which I have coded for various websites and applications

## How To Install (BetterDiscord Theme)
1. Go to https://github.com/DevFishh/Dark-Magenta-Themes/releases/tag/BetterDiscord
2. Under "Assets" click "DarkMagenta.theme.css" This should start the download process. 
3. After you download the file, move it into the BetterDiscord Themes folder.
4. Enjoy! Theme updates should be automatic. 
5. NOTES: The file you just downloaed injects the CSS which changes Discord. It should not need to be updated

## How To Install (Other Themes)
Each .css file has an info section at the beginning of the file.

"EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS" shows what software you need to execute the code.

If those requirements are met, all you need to do is copy the execution string and paste it into whatever software is required to inject the code.

Make sure you paste it BEFORE any other lines of code BUT AFTER any @charset declarations (such as @name , @version , @author , etc) or it will not work
